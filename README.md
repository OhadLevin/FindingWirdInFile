# FindingWirdInFile
This Project intention is to create program which searches for a word in a file.
The project should be modular, so we will define the "word iterator" as a modular thing (implemented a file word iterator but could be any stream in the future).

usage:
	FindWordInFile FILE_PATH WORD_TO_FIND.
	Use -c to be case sensative.

Future additions:
	pattern searching
